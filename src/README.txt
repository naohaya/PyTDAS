This simulator implemented in Python3 is for the assignments of distributed processing systems in KSU.

How to run on the simulator
python3 simulator.py <name of a project> <num of processes> 

Assumption:
* the directory of the given project should in the same directory as the simulator.
* the main script should be named "main.py".
* the main code should be started from run() in Main class.
* 

TODO: 
* primitives for sending/receiving messages should be implemented separated from the simulator.
