Assumption:
* Programmer should use Pyhton version 3.13.5 or higher. 
* The directory of the given project should in the same directory as the simulator.
* The main script should be named "main.py".
* The main code should be started from run() in Main class.
* 

TODO: 
* primitives for sending/receiving messages should be implemented separated from the simulator.
